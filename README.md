Using a PDF javascript library documented here: https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF

NOTE: This was done in a dev org without access to the Traction Rec package. The Facility Visit object and fields are dummies, meant only to stage this solution. Please substitute references to object and field api names accordingly.
